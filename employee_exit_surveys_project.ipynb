    "\n",
    "- The DETE employee exit survey reveals that most departures were due to age retirement and various forms of resignation, with the workforce largely composed of older employees, particularly those aged 56 and above. Teaching roles dominated the data, and common reasons for leaving included job dissatisfaction, interpersonal conflicts, and lack of recognition. Several data fields, especially around diversity and classification, were incomplete. To address these findings, DETE should focus on improving retention through better workplace support, succession planning for an aging workforce, and more consistent data collectionâ€”particularly in diversity and employee feedback areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Findings From The Technical and Further Education (TAFE) Survey\n",
    "\n",
    "- The dataset contains 702 employee exit records from various TAFE institute, with 72 columns covering demographics, reasons for leaving, contributing factors, workplace views, and induction experiences. Key fields include cessation year, reason for leaving, and satisfaction ratings. Some columns have significant missing data, especially in contributing factors and demographic sections. Most records come from a few major institutes. The next steps could involve cleaning the data, analyzing exit reasons, comparing institute satisfaction, or visualizing trends, depending on the analysis goals.Unlike the DETE survey, the data collection from the TAFE suvey was not standardized, hence, most of the column variables have different names and this most likely contributes to the majority of the missing data."

    "### Explanation of Changes\n",
    "A new column named `'dissatisfied'` was added to both the `dete_resignations` and `tafe_resignations` DataFrames to indicate whether an employee experienced any form of job dissatisfaction. In the `dete_resignations` DataFrame, this column was created by evaluating multiple relevant columnsâ€”such as `job_dissatisfaction, workload, and lack_of_recognition` using `.any(axis=1, skipna=False)` to return True if any of the selected values in a row indicated `dissatisfaction`. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the `tafe_resignations` DataFrame, two dissatisfaction-related columns were processed with a custom function to convert values to True, False, or NaN. The results were then combined using `.any(axis=1)` to produce a single Boolean outcome. These changes make it easier to identify dissatisfied employees and perform consistent analysis across both datasets."
